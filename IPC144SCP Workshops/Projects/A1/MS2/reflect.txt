Assignment: 1
Milestone:  2

1- No, I can't think of a more efficient way to ask a user to add the required information to each data field.

2- C string that is required to store up to 25 characters must be capable of storing 26 characters because string stores values from 0 to 25. so, we have to put 26 because first value will be 0.
