Assignment: 1
Milestone:  4

1 - We used Contact structure that holds three other structs because we just need one function instead of three functions to get multiple values.

2 - The most difficult part of this assignment to connect three programs together and solving the errors with all three.

3 - It took me 4 days to complete Miletone 4.
