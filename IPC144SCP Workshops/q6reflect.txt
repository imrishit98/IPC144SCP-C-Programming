Void prnCellNumber prn;
scanf("%s",prn);
getprn(prn);
printf("%c",prn);
printf("%d",areacode);
printf("%d",number);

Correct answer:

void prnCellNumber (const struct Cellnumber* p) {
printf("%-30s|%3d-%7d\n",p->name,p->areacode,p->number);
}

2- Is the function you wrote above efficient with respect to the amount of data passed through the structure argument?If not how can you fix it?

What i wrote:
The function is efficient with respect to the amount of data passed through the structure argument because name member has 31 spaces.

Correct answer:
The function is not efficient.

3- Write a function (emptyCellNumber) that empties all the values in a CelNumber structure to Name to an empty string
Area code and number to -1

What i wrote:
void emptyCellNumber(void){
clearkeyboard;

Correct answer:
void emptyCellNumber(void){
name = 0;
areacode = -1;
number = -1;
}
